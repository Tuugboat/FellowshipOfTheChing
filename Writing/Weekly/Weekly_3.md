# A Merry Fellow Appears!

We open this week with wonderful news! Having covered 35.27 FrodoMiles
this week, we hit 98.71 miles and *barely* squeaked into Tom Bombadil’s
House at the 98 mile mark! I am pleased with our mileage this week,
especially considering the *two* people who did not run this week due to
injury (Robert and Jet). Our fun graph this graph this week gives us
some wonderful insights as to who earned these bonus miles:

We had only two consequential reductions, both of them injured. Everyone
ran pretty much the same, or more than they did the previous week. The
biggest gain on this front was our dear Alexander, but in a week in
which we met our mark by less than a mile, every single bit counts so
massive pats on the back all around.

Noah once again claims the Frodo mantle, covering a substantial 13.4
FrodoMiles. Alex brings up the time commitment with 105 minutes of
effort. This being each of their second time with the accolades (Noah
was Frodo last week, Alex was Sam in week 1) it falls to each of us
ringwraiths on their tails to dethrone them. Ring a dong and hop along,
good luck next week: the Pride Month writeups will be spicy.
