# The 'Back Again' Part

![Data Boy is Back!](Images/ReturnOfTheData.png)

So, now that I am officially done moving I would like to thank everyone for continuing to post their runs as they are doing them. It was a long journey, but I am now in California and settled, with plans to return to running tomorrow. The break was longer than intended, but there's some new hills for me and Rachel to run, which is nice.

As for the mileage, we covered 40 miles during the interlude (for a total of 140 miles so far) which means we got to Bree! With a nice night of drinking we'll meet a tall dark stranger, have a night filled with stabbing 'pillows', and get back out to the track. Our next big scene is at weathertop in 23 miles; As people get back into running, this is a *very* doable goal for a week.

# Some short accolades

Honestly, a bit of my summary scripts don't handle multi-week breaks very well. Noah definitley had the most mileage covered in the break, so he remains our Frodo. He also became the first of us to break the 7:00 mile mark, which is huge. It will be hard to catch him at this point, but I am sure we will try. Miller again had substantial time investment and is this 'weeks' Sam, he also took the #2 spot on total mileage.

Again, apologies for the longer-than-expected break, but we should have a longer stint of consistency from here forward. Looking forward to seeing everyone at Weathertop!
