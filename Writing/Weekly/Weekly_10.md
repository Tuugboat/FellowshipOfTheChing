# The ‘Back Again’ Part

So, now that I am officially done moving I would like to thank everyone
for continuing to post their runs as they are doing them. It was a long
journey, but I am now in California and settled, with plans to return to
running tomorrow. The break was longer than intended, but there’s some
new hills for me and Rachel to run, which is nice.

As for the mileage, we covered 40 miles during the interlude (for a
total of 140 miles so far) which means we got to Bree! With a nice night
of drinking we’ll meet a tall dark stranger, have a night filled with
stabbing ‘pillows’, and get back out to the track. Our next big scene is
at weathertop in 23 miles; As people get back into running, this is a
*very* doable goal for a week.

# Some short accolades

Honestly, a bit of my summary scripts don’t handle multi-week breaks
very well. Noah definitley had the most mileage covered in the break, so
he remains our Frodo. He also became the first of us to break the 7:00
mile mark, which is huge. It will be hard to catch him at this point,
but I am sure we will try. Miller again had substantial time investment
and is this ‘weeks’ Sam, he also took the \#2 spot on total mileage.

Again, apologies for the longer-than-expected break, but we should have
a longer stint of consistency from here forward. Looking forward to
seeing everyone at Weathertop!
